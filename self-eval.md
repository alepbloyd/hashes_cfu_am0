# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
 - *I posted a question about this in slack, but I am struggling to understand the difference between hashes that are declared with ":" separating the key/value pair, and hashes that are declared with "=>" separating the key/value pair. Ultimately I just rewrote the variable in a way that seemed to get me the result I wanted, but don't know if that was intended.*
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
 - *Notes are good so far! I usually take notes for a page, and then I have a section at the top where I title what I covered on that page AFTER I have completed the page, and also go back and highlight all of chunks that are terminal or ruby commands so they stand out. I mostly take notes if it's during a live lesson, or if I struggled to find something on google and think it's worth writing down so I don't have to find again.*
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
 - *I'll usually try to solve on my own first, and then if I think I need something I haven't learned yet or need to refresh my memory on, I've got no problem going to google on it.*
